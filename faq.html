<center><h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2></center>

<h3>What is Fest Request?</h3><BR /><p2>Fest Request is a crowd funding platform for individuals looking to host their own music festival, concert, or pop up party. Fest Request is full of  organizers who want to make their dream into an event that fans “get stoked” about so they can make that dream a reality.</p2>

<h3>How does Fest Request work?</h3><BR /><p2>Lots of different events are being funded on Fest Request at any given moment. Each event is independently created and is run by the organizer behind the event. The organizers or party promoters you see on Fest Request have complete control and responsibility for the execution of the event they are envisioning. They spend weeks connecting with local musicians, artists  and venues to create a realistic budget to make their event a reality. When they are ready to get people “stoked” about their event, organizers launch their plan on FestRequest and share it with their community.<br /><BR />Organizers create a promotion page, set a funding goal, and establish a commitment deadline. If individuals have an interest in attending the event, they “get stoked” meaning they make a fiscal pledge to attend in the future. The organizer receives funds only after the organizer has met their goal. If the event succeeds in getting enough people stoked about the event, all backers’ credit cards are charged when time expires. If the event falls short of the funding goal, no one is charged. Funding on Fest Request is all or nothing.</p2>
<h3>Why is funding all or nothing?</h3><BR /><p2>
All or nothing funding is a core component of Fest Request and it has a number of advantages.
It’s less risk for everyone. If you need $5,000  to make an event happen, its tough having $1,000 and a bunch of people expecting you to host an event worth $5,000.
It motivates. If people see an awesome event that they are stoked about, they are going to spread the word.
It helps you! Events will either receive full funding right away or never reach their quota. However, this is a great gauge for interest in the event itself without worrying about losing money on overhead costs for parties with little attendance.
</p2>
<h3>Can Fest Request fund anything?</h3><BR /><p2>No. At the moment we are only allowing individuals asking for funding for festivals, concerts, or pop-up parties to utilize our platform. Everything on FestRequest must be event oriented.
If you are looking to fund a project or raise money for a particular cause, this crowdfunding option may not be for you. Check out our guidelines for more information as to what is not allowed.
</p2>
<h3>Does Fest Request screen event campaigns before they launch?</h3><BR /><p2>Only a quick review to make sure they meet our event guidelines. Fest Request does not investigate a creator's ability to execute their event plan. Backers ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of an event by whether they decide to “get stoked” about it. Please refer to the accountability section for more.</p2>
<h3>Why do people “get stoked” about events?</h3><BR /><p2>A lot of people rally around their friend’s festival or party idea. Some individuals are supporting the artist in attendance. Others may just be looking for an awesome event to attend in their area. Regardless of how they get to the site, once a person is stoked, they do everything in their power to spread the awesomeness with their network.</p2>
<h3>Where do backers come from?</h3><BR /><p2>In most cases, the initial people who tend to get stoked about the event comes from the fans and friends of each organizer. If they like, they’ll spread the words to their friends, and so on to try to get them stoked about it as well!</p2>
